webxr template that I use to teach three.js based development  

# usage

Make sure to have webpack installed: `npm instsall webpack`  
To run: `npm run dev`  

# locomotion  

Use the controller's joystick to teleport. rotating away from  
the origin activates the teleportation arc, and resetting to the origin  
performs the teleportation.
